# URL saver!!

This is a project I initially coded for a university assignment.
The goal was to create a website where we could save URLs. 
This was done using the following frameworks:
    -Flask for the backend
    -SQLAlchemy for the db
    -HTML and bootstrap for the frontend

# In order to get the website running on your local host, run server.py
# Enjoy!
